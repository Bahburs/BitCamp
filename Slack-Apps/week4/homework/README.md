### Homework

The Homework Portion of Week 4 is a review of the topics that are covered in the livestream. Students will follow a GitHub Learning Lab that outlines the basics of coding using webhooks. There are issues for creating GET and POST methods in Express and creating up a GitHub webhook. The last issue is a guided project similar to the one demonstrated in the livestream. Overall, the purpose of the homework this week is to expose students to the versatility of webhooks.
