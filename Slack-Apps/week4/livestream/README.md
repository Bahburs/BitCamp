### Livestream

The Livestream Portion of Week 4 involves webhooks and the Express framework.  Students will learn about the usecases for a webhook, as well as how Express can be used to receive webhook payloads. The livestream covers GitHub webhooks, namely demonstrating the process of setting up a webhook and receiving a payload. The mentor leading the stream teaches these principles through a sample project: listening for a repository to be starred, then messaging a Slack channel when the event occurs.
