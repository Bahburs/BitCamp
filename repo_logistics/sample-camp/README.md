# Bitcamp [Camp Name]

*[Short and concise description about the camp. Should describe why and how the particular skill (ex: serverless functions) is important] Example: "Serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost. Functions is also a great solution for processing bulk data, integrating systems, working with the internet-of-things (IoT), and building simple APIs and micro-services."*

## The Goal ðŸ¥…
**Who?** *[What is the audience of this BitCamp? What is their level of experience with this content?] Example: "Built with the audience of college and high school students that have minimal to advanced coding experience in mind. Most do not have experience with APIs with serverless architectures."*

**What?** *[How is the curriculum going to be presented? A Learning Lab? What is the Learning Lab about?] Example: "Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to serverless architectures with Microsoft Azure Functions"*

**How?** *[How are students going to learn? Are they going to build a project? What is the project about? Provide an example project if you can!] Example: "Students gain experience through building a complete web app with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Azure Functions, NodeJS). The web app's input is a picture, and it analzyes the image to display emotion data."*

**When?** 
*[Give a quick overview of the camp. When is everything taking place? In what weeks?]*
 
*Example:* 
* *Starting out: Week 0 consists of an introductory JS project and Week 1 assists students in setting up with VSCode, a basic Azure Function, and Github.*
* *The project: Week 2 (backend) and Week 3 (frontend) is when students begin building their "Emotion Detector"*

**Where?** *[Where is everything taking place - what tools are you using? What tools will students need to be successful in the camp?] Example: "Tools used include VScode, Github, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, and Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API)."*
