### Bit Camp by Bit Project

#### Background

[Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to making tech equitable by providing free open source education. We believe lack of accessibility is a prominent issue in the technology industry and we’re aiming to solve it. 

Top schools provide their students with access to countless educational resources, student organizations, and networking opportunities outside of the classroom. Additionally, the “brand” of these schools alone can open doors for their graduates. But what about the majority of schools that don’t have these resources? Their students are left trying to find their own ways to stay marketable in a competitive industry. With their heavy course loads and busy schedules, students are not easily able to supplement their education by themselves. Non-traditional paths, like software engineering bootcamps, are often expensive and inaccessible to underserved communities. To help bridge this gap, we offer a free open source alternative, called “Bit Camps”, to teach beginner students a variety of topics relevant to the software engineering field.

#### Bit Camps Repository

This repository includes folders of curriculum for each of our Bit Camps. Our Bit Camps consist of weekly livestreams and homework assignments and conclude with a final project. Student volunteers act as livestream hosts and TAs to teach the curriculum and conduct office hours. For those of our Bit Camps sponsored by industry partners, a developer advocate often co-hosts the livestream and engineers serve as mentors to help students understand concepts and complete their final projects. Although mentorship and feedback on homeworks/final projects are only available to students who apply and get into the bootcamp, the curriculum is free and open to all.

In the past, our curriculum has been created by student developers, sometimes in collaboration with industry partners for our sponsored Bit Camps. As an open source organization, we want to increase community involvement and encourage more developers to contribute to our content. Each Bit Camp directory includes a readme describing the program syllabus, as well as folders for livestreams and homeworks. If you think any of our existing content is confusing to understand for beginners, too easy, too hard, etc., open a PR and let us know! We welcome all suggestions and edits to our repo.
