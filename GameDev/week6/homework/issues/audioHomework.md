Now, what I’d like for you to do this week is to find some sound assets of your own, either using the websites I’ve shown you, some other source, or even your own recording. Even though we’re not working on this project commercially, be aware of the audio’s licensing as you’re searching. Ideally, get one background music track, and two sound effects for jumping and crashing. Add them to the project folder and integrate them into this game!

For further mastery of audio:
-One issue with the game is that the music keeps playing when the game ends. How can you use Audio Source’s Stop() method to cut the music off at the right time?
-How about a fade effect instead, so the cut isn’t so sudden? We need to adjust both the Audio Source’s volume and pitch over time to make this work.
