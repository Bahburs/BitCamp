This week we will finish the game we started last week by adding a main menu with buttons that control the difficulty. Then we will move on to another example to showcase more UI elements. More specifically, we will show an inventory system that uses grids and images among other things. Starter code is given in this folder. Please note that the Inventory system is currently in Unity version 2020.1.
