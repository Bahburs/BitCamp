# How to Contribute (*Bit Project Style*)

Welcome open-source user! We're glad to have you here. You're probably interested in contributing to our open-source repositories here at Bit Project. Before we go over the standards of contributing to our repos, let's go over few key points to help you get started.

First of all, how it works. While contributing might seem quick and easy, the process is quite difficult to the regular newcomer. If you have some knowledge of Github (example: what an issue is, forking, creating a pull request) then feel free to skip this part. If not, here is a quick summary of some important terms and a few helpful links if you're just starting with Github.

### Key Terms

|  Term | Meaning  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Issue  | Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They’re kind of like email—except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.  |
| Forking  | Forking in GitHub is a process of creating a copy of a complete repository to the user’s GitHub Account from another account. When a user forks a repository, all the files in the repository are automatically copied to the user’s account on GitHub and it feels like the user’s own repository.  |
| Pull Request  |A pull request in GitHub is a request to the maintainer of a repository to pull in some code. When you write some code that you want to contribute to a repository, you create and submit a pull request. Your code contains some proposed changes to the target repository. |
| Repository |Just like a repository on Git is a Git repository. A repository is similar to a folder and a GitHub repository becomes a folder that is available online on the cloud for the people to download, access and contribute. This folder contains the code files of the project which can now be used by the other people.|


### Types of Issues

| Term  | Meaning  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Bug  | When an issue is labelled as a bug, there is an issue within the given file/folder. This could be a typo in the code or markdown file or even mean there is still a missing part to a repository that needs to be added.  |
|  Documentation | When an issue is labelled as documentation, there is an issue within the markdown file of the given folder/repository. This could be a typo in the repository documentation or even mean a part needs to be created or added to complete the documentation fully. |
|  Newcomer | When an issue is labelled as newcomer, the issue is for new users who don't have as much experience with Github or open-source contributions in general. Usually these issues will be much easier tasks like fixing typing errors, code errors, and more.  |
|  Specifics (example: slack, serverless, etc) | When an issue is labelled with specifics, the issue is focused on a certain Bit Camp. While these labels don't change the difficulty or type of issue, they are used to specify which course the issue is targetted towards.  |

## Getting Started

Now it's time to start contributing! At this point, you should have a decent introduction to the basics of Github and our repository specific labels (these are super important for issues)!

### Choosing an Issue

When it comes to picking which issue you want to work on, it all depends on a two key aspects: the level of difficulty and availability. 

*Difficulty* : When viewing all open issues, finding the difficulty of the issue will be based on whether the issue is labelled with "newcomer" or "good first issue". If the issue you want to contribute to isn't labelled with said newcomer labels, it is most likely more difficult then simply a small text/code error.

*Availability* : When viewing all open issues, availability will be based on whether the issue is closed or open, and whether the issue has been assigned to a Bit Project member. If the issue is assigned, it means the issue is NOT for open-source users. If you view an issue that is open and unassigned, feel free to contribute to it!
