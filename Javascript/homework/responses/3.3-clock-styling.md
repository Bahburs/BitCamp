### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 3: Building the background of your clock

Moving to the css file, style the clock so that it's a circle with a solid black border. Also add a small circle in the middle of the clock.
