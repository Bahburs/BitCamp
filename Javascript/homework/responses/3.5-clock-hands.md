### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 5: Designing the hands of your clock

Style the hands so that the seconds hand is the longest and thinnest, and the hour hand is shortest and widest. These hands should also be set to rotate given a degree.
