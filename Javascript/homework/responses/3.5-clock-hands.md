### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 5: Designing the hands of your clock

Within your clock div you're going to include three more divsions. - these will represent the hands on our clock.  For each div, set the class to "hand [type of hand]" and set the data-* attribute to `data-[type of hand]-hand`.  For example, the div tag for the hour hand would look like:

`<div class="hand hour" data-hour-hand></div>`

Repeat this for the minute hand and the second hand.

Though this div-defining process seems complicated, it will greatly simplify things when we design our clock hands in the CSS file.

We'll want all three of our hands to have some similar attributes, so in your css file, define a block that selects all items within the clock class with "hand" in their class.  The definition of this field will be similar to the way we defined the first number section in the last task, so your code should look like this:

`.clock .hand { }`

Inside of this block, set the `bottom` and `left` attributes to 50%, which will place the hands at the center of the clock.  Next, set `position` to `absolute` so that the hands are anchored to the clock.

We'll change this later, but just so you get an idea of what we're doing, set your `height` and `width` to some arbitrary values and your background color to black.  I set my height to 40% and my width to 10px and this is how my clock looks at this point in the code.

As you can see, the hand is slightly off center, which is the same issue we had earlier with the circle in the center of the clock.  Since we just want to move the hand to the left, we'll use the same trick as we did earlier, but this time the y-coordinate in the translate function will be 0, like so:

`transform: translate(-50%, 0)`

Next, we want to add a white border around the hands so that they are easier to see when they're overlapping.  Finally, we'll round the edges of the hands by setting the `border-top-left-radius` and `border-top-right-radius` attributes to `10px`.

Now, let's style each hand to be unique.  To select the second hand, we'll define a block:

`.clock .hand.second{ }`

Make sure to leave no space between `.hand` and `.second`, as this will be crucial to your definition.  Repeat this process for the minute hand and the hour hand.

In each of these blocks, customize the hands so that the seconds hand is the longest and thinnest, and the hour hand is shortest and widest.  You should also override the current `background-color` attribute for the seconds hand by setting it to red in the `.clock .hand.second` block.

Now, your clock should look something like this:

To make sure that the second hand is always on top set it's `z-index` attribute to 12.  Similarly, we'll want the hour hand to always be on the bottom and the minute hand in the middle so set their `z-index` attributes to 10 and 11 respectively.  We'll also want the small circle in the center of the clock to always be on top of all of the hands to hide the overlap so we can set the `z-index` in `clock::after` to 100.  This attribute defines the order in which items will appear on the z-axis, so items with a higher z-index will appear to sit on top of items with a lower z-index.

Now that we have all of the styling done for the clock, it's time to get the hands moving!
