### Week 1 - Printing the time using JS and HTML 

*In this assignment, students will gain a thorough understanding of basic HTML syntax as well as JavaScript functions to print out the current time given some user input* 

#### Task 1: Environment setup and starting your first HTML file

If you have not already set up your environment for this course, be sure to watch the loom video (this is where I'd add a link to the video I'm gonna create about setting up your environment) and download [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for your machine. 

Once installed, open the application and create a new folder for this class.  Inside of that folder, create another folder for this week's homework - you should have a separate folder for every assignment to keep your code organized.  Once you've selected your week 1 homework folder, create a new HTML file and title it "index.html".  

After you've opened this file, type "html" in the editor and select the shortcut "html:5".  This will automatically type out some mandatory HTML syntax for you.

When your file is all set up, add a title and make your page print "Hello World!"
