### Week 2 - Designing a digital clock using CSS

*In this week's assignment, students will build off of last weeks work and style their existing webpage to produce a more aesthetically pleasing digital clock.*

#### Task 2: Styling the body

In your CSS file, define a body class and set the display to flex.  This will make sure all elements fit the screen appropriately. Next, use the `justify-content`  and `align-items` attributes to center your items on the y axis and the x axis respectively. You may also want to set the `min-height` to `100vh` so that height of your content will always be relative to the size of the screen.

Inside the body, you can also change the color of the background, as well as the color, font, and size of your text.  I recommend using the `font-family` attribute with a few backup fonts in case your browser doesn't support your font of choice.  You can add back up fonts by following your font with a comma and another font family or type. My font-family line looks like this:

`font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Verdana, sans-serif;`
