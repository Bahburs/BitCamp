### Week 2 - Designing a digital clock using CSS

*In this week's assignment, students will build off of last weeks work and style their existing webpage to produce a more aesthetically pleasing digital clock.*

#### Task 3: Creating your clock

After you're satisfied with the body of your page, define a block that styles elements in the `clock` class.

First, set a width and a height for the box that's going to hold your time.  Add a background and a solid border using colors different from the screen's background so you can see what the box will look like.

Once again, you'll want to set your `display` to `flex` and center your text using `align-items` and `justify-content` .  You need to do this again because these attributes in the body only centered the box on your page; repeating these lines in the clock section will center your text within the box.

You may also want to adjust the margins of your clock so that theres some space between the box and the form - I simply adjusted the left margin of my clock.

You can add as many bells and whistles to this clock that you please.  I increased the font-size here and added a box-shadow to add some depth to my clock.

The first number in each line represents the x-offset which is the horizontal distance from which you want the object to appear.  The second number is the y-offset - the vertical distance from which the box will appear.  The third number is the blur radius - a larger blur radius will create a bigger shadow and vice versa. 

Lastly is the color.  I used the `rgba()` tool to define my color.  The first 3 numbers represent the amount of red, green, and blue in the color, respectively. The fourth number is the opacity on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being complete transparency and 1 being fully opaque.
