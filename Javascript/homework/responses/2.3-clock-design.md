## Task 3: Creating your clock

#### For the third task, we're going to begin designing a digital clock using some basic styling techniques.

After you're satisfied with the body of your page, define a selector that styles elements in the `clock` class.

<details><summary>What is a selector?</summary>
<p>

#### CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements (which is going to be our time div) that you want to style.

```css
.Clock{

}
```

</p>
</details>

### Once you have a selector that is defineing .clock we're going to move onto the steps below.
- Within your new .clock body you're going to set a width and a height to 100px. That's going to hold your time  
- Then add a background and a solid border using colors different from the screen's background so you can see what the box will look like.
  - Use the `background-color` and `border` attributes for these items respectively

- Set your `display` to `flex` 
- Center your text using `align-items` and `justify-content` 

You may also want to adjust the margins of your clock so that theres some space between the box and the form - I simply adjusted the left margin of my clock.

#### Open a pull request for your code

Once again, be sure create a new branch, titled `[your GitHub username]-[week]-[task number]`, for your task.  

After you've created your branch, commit your code to this branch and open a pull request to merge with your main branch.  

As long as there are no conflicts with the base branch, you can now merge your pull request with your main branch. From here, click on "Issues" on the top left of your screen, below the name of your repository, and click on the week. A new comment should have appeared for your next task where you'll find the instructions for task 4.
