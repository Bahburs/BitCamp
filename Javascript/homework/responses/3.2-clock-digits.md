### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 2: Adding numbers to your clock

Inside of your clock div (which should be located inside of the body, but outside of the form) define three divs - these will represent the hands on our clock.  For each div, set the class to "hand [type of hand]" and set the data-* attribute to `data-[type of hand]-hand`.  For example, the div tag for the hour hand would look like:

`<div class="hand hour" data-hour-hand></div>`

Though this div-defining process seems complex, it will greatly simplify things when we design our clock in the CSS file.

Next, we need to set up the numbers on our clock

Inside of this, define divs for numbers 1-12 and as well as divs for each hand on the clock.
