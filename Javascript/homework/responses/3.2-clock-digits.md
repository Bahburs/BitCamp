### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 2: Adding numbers to your clock

Define a clock class in a div separate from the timezone form, but still in the body of the code. Inside of this, define divs for numbers 1-12 and as well as divs for each hand on the clock.
