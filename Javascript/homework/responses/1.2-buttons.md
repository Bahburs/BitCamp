### Week 1 - Printing the time using JS and HTML 

*In this assignment, students will gain a thorough understanding of basic HTML syntax as well as JavaScript functions to print out the current time given some user input*

#### Task 2: Getting user input with buttons.

Next, lets set up a form for a user to select their timezone for the clock we're going to build.  To do this, we'll use radio buttons - these are the type of buttons that you'd associate with a multiple choice question - there are a few different options to select, but, since we only want to show one time, we only want the user to be able to select one of these buttons.

Radio buttons can be defined using the HTML `input` field if you set the `type` attribute to `"radio"`.  In order to let the computer know that these items are in a group, be sure to give each input field the same same `name` attribute (I named mine `"timezone"`). Each item should also have a unique value tag.

Once you've set up your input fields, feel free to add some labels and breaks to make your form easier to read.  Next, we need to add a submit button.  This can be defined using a `button` tag with the` type` attribute set to `"button"` and `value` attribute set to `"Submit"`.  

Whenever we want to take in some user input involving input fields and a submit button, we want to make sure to group our relevant code in the `form` tag so that the computer knows what to look for.  With that being said, make sure to surround your code related to the input fields and submit button with a form tag.

Finally, add a break and a `div` tag with a unique `id` right below the submit button.  We will use this later to print the selected timezone.
