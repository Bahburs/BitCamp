### Week 4 - Toggling between digital and analog clocks and incoporating advanced features

*For the final assignment, students will integrate all previous assignments into a single interface and add some bells and whistles.*

#### Task 2: Adding radio buttons for clock preferences

Next, we're going to create a set of radio buttons that allow a user to choose if theyâ€™d like to see the time on an analog clock or on a digital clock.

First, open another form tag directly below the one you have for the timezone selector.  Similar to how you set up the timezone buttons, open a div tag with a unique class (I named mine "view") and insert 2 radio buttons. Make sure these radio buttons share the same `name` attribute and have unique `value` and `id` attributes.

These two radio buttons should have the user input whether they'd like to see the time on a digital clock or an analog clock.  There's no need to add a submit button as we will set up our page to change on the click of the radio button rather than on the submit button.

After this step, your page should look like this:

At this point, you can customize the appearance of these two radio buttons in your CSS file by defining a block that selects all items in your "view" class.  I suggest adding some margins and padding so that items don't look so crowded.
