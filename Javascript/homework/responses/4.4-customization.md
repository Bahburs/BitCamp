### Week 4 - Toggling between digital and analog clocks and incoporating advanced features

*For the final assignment, students will integrate all previous assignments into a single interface and add some bells and whistles.*

#### Task 4: Adding bells and whistles

Now that your page incorporates all of your existing work and allows the user to toggle between a digital and analog clock, your task is almost complete. 

For the last task of your final assignment, you must add two features of your choosing to this page.  A feature can be as simple as adding a heading to your page, or as complex as having users enter a city and setting the clock to this city's time - just be creative.  We encourage that you use outside resources to implement any features that we haven't covered in this course.
