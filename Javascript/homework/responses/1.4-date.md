### Week 1 - Printing the time using JS and HTML 

*In this assignment, students will gain a thorough understanding of basic HTML syntax as well as JavaScript functions to print out the current time given some user input*

#### Task 4: Printing the time with JS

Next, we will print the time on your local machine onto the webpage with a simple JavaScript function.

First, define a new function inside your `script` tag, but outside of the function you just wrote for finding the selected radio button.  Define a new variable and set it equal to `new Date()`.  This will grab the current date and time from your local machine.

Next, create variables for the current hour, minute, and second using the respective `Date` functions.  You may also want to define a session variable that keeps track of whether your clock is showing "AM" or "PM" - you can do this using a few simple conditionals.

Once you've defined your time variables, define a new variable to concatenate the hour, minute, and second variables, each separated by a colon (you can also add your session variable here).

We'll want our clock to be updated every second, so, at the bottom of the function, call the `setTimeout()` function with the name of your clock function and `1000` as parameters.  This will call your function every 1000 ms (or 1 second) that your page is running.

Lastly, to print your clock, add a break and a div tag outside of your form tags.  Give this element a unique tag.  Now, scroll back down to your JavaScript clock function and use the document's `getElementById()` function to print your time variable, just as you did to print the form result in your previous function.

Now, you should have a working digital clock and a form that prints the item selected!

P.S. Don't forget call your clock function once at the bottom of your script!
