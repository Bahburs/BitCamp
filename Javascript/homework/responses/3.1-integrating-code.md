### Week 3 - Constructing an analog clock using HTML, JS, and CSS

*Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected timezone.*

#### Task 1: Gathering your existing code

Open new css and html in visual studio code in your week 3 folder.  This week will involve a little more JavaScript code, so you may want to make a separate JS file this time.  You can save it as "script.js" and link this file to your HTML file by adding the following line in your head, right below your CSS file link:

`<script defer src="script.js"></script>`

In script.js, you can copy and paste everything that was inside the script tag for your week 2 clock, you'll just want to delete the lines that print the time onto the screen.

You can also copy your HTML from last week, but make sure to remove the JavaScript code from your HTML document and add the tag above. Your CSS code from week 2 can also be copied as long as you clear out the clock styling.

If you've copied and filtered all your code correctly, this is what your page should look like:
