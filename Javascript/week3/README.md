# Week 3: Advanced Topics in HTML and CSS

Students will now use the knowledge and experience they've gained from building a digital clock to code a live analog clock that changes based on the user's selected time zone.

### Learning Objectives

- Understanding basic syntax for HTML, CSS, and JS
- Creating an analog clock from the digital clock

**We'll be going over:**

*1. Last week's homework*

*2. Advanced topics in CSS and HTML*

*3. Ideas relevant to this week's homework*

### Homework

In this week's homework assignment, you'll be building off of the clock you have already created and putting together an analog clock. This clock will still allow the user to input a timezone but, now, the time will be printed in the form of an analog clock, rather than a digital clock.  You can find the step-by-step instructions for this assigment in your GitHub learning lab for this course.

### :question: How will this help students?

The livestream will cover last week's homework, thus giving students who struggled to complete it an opportunity to ask questions and see where they may have made mistakes. We will also cover some advanced CSS and HTML topics and demo some examples relevant to these topics.  This will help prepare students for this week's homework assignment, as well as teach them how to manipulate objects in CSS. The homework will give students an opportunity to fine-tune their CSS skills and discover how much CSS is capable of.
