# Bitcamp Serverless âš¡

Serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost. Functions is also a great solution for processing bulk data, integrating systems, working with the internet-of-things (IoT), and building simple APIs and micro-services.

## The Goal ðŸ¥…
**Who?** Built with the audience of college and high school students that have minimal to advanced coding experience in mind. Most do not have experience with APIs with serverless architectures.

**What?** Concise and interactive Github Learning Lab that introduces and develops skills related to serverless architectures with [Microsoft Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)

**How?** Students gain experience through building a complete web app with a frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) and backend (Azure Functions, NodeJS). The web app's input is a picture, and it analzyes the image to display emotion data.

> Example of [frontend](https://express10ns.emilychen10.repl.co/) *Note: Azure Functions are disabled*

**When?** 
* *Starting out:* Week 0 consists of an introductory JS project and Week 1 assists students in setting up with VSCode, a basic Azure Function, and Github.
* *The project:* Week 2 (backend) and Week 3 (frontend) is when students begin building their "Emotion Detector"

**Where?** Tools used include VScode, Github, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Functions, and Microsoft Cognitive Services (Face API).
