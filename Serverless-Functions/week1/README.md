# Week 1: Setting Up

This week will focus on three topics: downloading an IDE (visual studio code), configuring and messing around with Azure, and figuring out how to use GitHub.

### ðŸ“š Summary
Students will **learn about and set up tools** needed for the completion of the "Emotion Reader" project. To show their mastery of these skills they will complete a simple HTTP Trigger function, commit files, and work with VSCode.

### Learning Objectives

- Downloading an IDE and Figuring Out the Basics
- Configuring Azure, specifically Azure Functions (create and deploy your first Function)
- Learning How to Use GitHub (commits, pull requests, etc)

### Livestream

In the livestream, we're going to be going over how to install an IDE, setting up an Azure account, and lastly, how to use GitHub (the basics).

- For the full video, look in the [video folder](https://github.com/bitprj/Bitcamp-Serverless/blob/master/week1/livestream/loom.md).
- For the full code, look in the [code folder](https://github.com/bitprj/Bitcamp-Serverless/tree/master/week1/homework/code/solution).

We'll be going over how to:

1. Installing Visual Studio Code
2. Creating an Azure Account
3. Learning the Basics of GitHub


### Homework

Your task is to follow a step by step guide on how to download an IDE, create an Azure account, and get started with GitHub. After that, on your own you will be completing 3 simple tasks to show your understanding of these programs.

### :question: How will this help students?

The livestream demonstrates step by step how to set up necessary resources needed to succeed in Bitcamp Serverless. It contains information that will assist them in completing the tasks for this week with these tools: an IDE, Azure, and Github.
